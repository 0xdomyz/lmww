# lmww

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of lmww is to support thinking of linear models in terms of factor
weights, instead of factor absolute coefficients. This means better interpretation
of the model drivers, which helps in creating confidence in the model.

## Installation

You can install the development version of lmww like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("0xdomyz/lmww")
```

## Example

Fit a linear model with weights:

```{r example}
library(lmww)
## basic example code
purrr::map(mtcars, std) |> dplyr::bind_cols()
```
